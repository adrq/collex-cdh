versions used in development:
Ruby: ruby 1.9.3p551

***Make sure solr is up and running before executing any of the following steps!***

Catalog Installation Steps:

- if necessary, start solr
- Rename and edit config/database.yml and config/secrets.yml
- run: bundle install --path vendor/bundle
- run: rake db:create
- run: rake db:migrate
- run: rake users:create user=email,password (use your own email and password)
- start server on port 3001: rails server -p 3001
- access localhost:3001/ in browser and log in to admin (botton of page)


Collex Installation Steps:

- Rename and edit config/database.yml and config/site.yml
- run: bundle install --path vendor/bundle
- open Gemfile and comment out capistrano lines
- run: rake db:setup
- run: rake db:migrate
- run: rake bootstrap:globals url=http://localhost:3001
- run: rails server


Databases:

- Access Catalog (localhost:3001/) and log in to admin
- Click on "Manage archives" and then "Add Category"
- Add 4 items with names "node1", "node2", "archive1", "archive2"
- Access mysql and view then update 'archives' table in the 'collex_catalog_development' database:

##This is an ugly hack to be able to get Collex to run initially.
##Ruby crashes if there aren't at least 2 items each in the 
## nodes[] and archives[] objects
- run the following sql commands on your mysql server. Make sure you select the catalog database.
  USE collex_catalog_development
  SELECT * FROM archives
  UPDATE archives SET typ='archive' WHERE name LIKE 'archive%'


Running Collex:

- Access Collex from web browser(http://localhost/) and log in with 'admin' and 'password'


Configuration

Catalog:
- Log in to admin, click on "Manage federations" (bottom of page). Add relevant information and IP addresses. If IP addresses are not set, then Collex will not be able to access Catalog.
