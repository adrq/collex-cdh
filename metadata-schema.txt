Custom namespace identifies the project. Examples:
walters:wam
rose:book
rose:illus
diamm:diamm

rdf:about is a URI that uniquely identifies the record.

Example: <pennington:baldus_consilia rdf:about="http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/balcon2.htm">


<collex:archive> 
A shorthand reference to the contributing project or collection. Single word (no spaces)
Examples from NINES:
DIAMM
WALTERS
BL
For LL, here are some values:
AMES
CCL
COLBY
PENNINGTON
Required? YES
	Can appear multiple? No.
	
Example: <collex:archive>pennington</collex:archive>


<dc:title>
Title of the object. Format will depend on the type of object, and its context. Titles may be created by combining fields from the source metadata.
examples:
Laylá and Majnūn reunited in the wilderness, W.605, fol. 100a (Walters)
Pierre Alexandre, Praelectiones de matrimonio (Parker)
Wing, right (fragment of a diptych), 1 register, 1 arch across (plaquette) (Courtauld)

<dc:type> 
A value (may be more than one) to describe the medium or format of an object. Think of this as the material of which the object physically consists (whether as solid, still matter or a moving image or a sound).  
Values must come from the following controlled list:
Might also consider using DCMI Type Vocabulary http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/#dcmitype-Collection
Codex
Collection
Drawing
Illustration
Interactive Resource
Manuscript

Physical Object
Roll
Sheet
Still Image

We might have to create our own namespace to define list of allowed types <ll:type>.

Example: <dc:type>Text</dc:type>

<collex:genre>
Basic descriptive genre for the object. 
This is different from TYPE in that it describes the resource by its customary or conventional classification – how does it fit into human cultural production? For instance, the genre may be poetry but the type might be variously a manuscript, sheet or a typescript. 

Drawn from a controlled list. We will have to either extend the <collex:genre> namespace or create our own to define controlled list for this project.
Controlled list:
Canon
Code of laws
Commentary
Consilium
Decretal
Imperial constitution
Purely for reference, following are examples from NINES. There is a complete list on the Collex Wiki.
Scripture
Sermon
Poetry
Visual Art

Machine-readable dates must be either

 - two four-digit years, separated by a comma, indicating a span of time e.g.“1425,1450”
 - three digits followed by “u”, indicating a decade, e.g. “145u”
 - two digits followed by “uu”, indicating a century, e.g. “08uu”
 
Example: <dc:date>1327,1400</dc:date>


<collex:date>

Labels can be any human-readable date, and will be displayed in LL.
Examples:
14th century
not before 1475
c. 1100
1300-1350


<rdfs:seeAlso>
URL pointing from LL Collex back to the digital object out there in a digital repository/collection somewhere on the interweb.

Example: <rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/balcon2.htm"/>


<provenance?>
A statement of any changes in ownership and custody of the object since its creation that are significant for its authenticity, integrity, and interpretation. Includes origin.


<collex:freeculture>
Is the digital version of the object “free”, i.e. in the public domain or released under an open access license? If yes, then the permalink in SEE ALSO should lead to the digital surrogate without any proxy or pay wall. 
Values: true or false 
Required? Yes.
Can appear multiple? No.

Example: <collex:freeculture>true</collex:freeculture>


<collex:federation>
Value:
The value for this field is always Libri legales.
Required.



OPTIONAL FIELDS

<collex:text> & <collex:fulltext>
The purpose of this field is to either hold or point directly to a digital transcript of the resource. Data in this field will be available for full-text searching in LL. 

We need to discuss cases of excerpts vs. actual full text.


<collex:image>
Points to the web-accessible, full-size digital image (a.k.a. digital surrogate) of the object.
Not required.
Can appear multiple? No. 


<dcterms:alternative>
An alternative title, for example a nickname for a manuscript when the official title is provided in TITLE.
This field should also be used to record customary forms of citation, in other words, conventional ways that the object might be referred to, e.g. “Const. Antonin.”, “X”, or “Digestum Vetus.” Perhaps even conventional, ambiguous shorthand forms of citation, such as “Paulus”.
Not required.
Can appear multiple? Yes. 

Example: <dcterms:alternative>Baldus de Ubaldis and the Authority of the Prince</dcterms:alternative>


<dc:source>
Title of the larger work, resource, or collection of which the present object takes part. Can be used for the title of a journal, anthology, book, online collection, etc.
Not required.
Good practice: Recommended whenever applicable (which will be often). See related Is Part Of  field.


SUBJECT
might be merged with “discipline”?
Subject keywords that can be used for searching. May be populated from a project’s existing keyword lists. 
Not required.
Can appear multiple? Yes. 


<collex:source_xml>

Not required.
Can appear multiple? No.


<collex:source_html>
Points to the web-accessible source code for the item metadata in HTML format.
Use for example if you have an HTML version of a manuscript description (i.e. metadata) available in source.
Do not use if it is the same as the object you are pointing to.
Example:
<collex:source_html>http://thedigitalwalters.org/Data/WaltersManuscripts/html/W683/description.html</collex:source_html>
Not required.
Can appear multiple? No.
